# Notes
The purpose of this file is to provide collaborators with qaulitative information regarding malaria, datasets, and other content within this project.

## Mok et al.
This file contains clinical data regarding malaria samples. Each datum is broken down into 10 different features. They are descirbed as follows:
* `SampleID` -> Identifier
* `GenotypeID` -> Identifier
* `Clearence` -> Time it takes to remove substance from system
* `Timepoint` -> N/A
* `Country` -> Country location of datum
* `Fieldsite` -> Local location of datum
* `RNA` -> N/A
* `Asexual_stage` -> N/A
* `Lifestage` -> N/A
* `Long_class` -> N/A

## Zhu et al.

* `SampleID` -> Identifier
* `SampleID.Pf3k` -> Identifier
* `FieldsiteName` -> Local location of datum
* `Country` -> Country location of datum
* `Hemoglobin.g.dL.` -> Hemoglobin count in bloodstream in g/dl
* `Hematocrit...` -> Measurement of the amount of red blood cells as related to total blood cell count
* `parasitemia` -> Measurement of substances in bloodstream
* `Parasite.count` -> Total number of substances in bloodstream
* `Sample.collection.time.24hr.` -> Time of sample collection
* `Patient.temperature` -> Temperature of patient measured in celcius
* `Drug` -> Type of drug used
* `ACT_partnerdrug` -> Type of Artemisinin-based combination therapy used
* `Parasites.clearance.time` -> Time it takes to remove substance from system
* `Duration.of.lag.phase` -> Time it takes for clearence to begin
* `PC50` -> Time it takes to remove 50% substance from system
* `PC90` -> Time it takes to remove 90% substance from system
* `Estimated.HPI` -> N/A
