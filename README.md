# malariaML
### Authors: Nasib, Lydia, James
The purose of this repository is to develop and effective machine learning (ML) algorithm based off Cai John's Extreme Phenotype Sampling Machine Learning (ESL-ML) respository in order to predict clearance* for malaria when given dosages of pharmaceuticals.  

The randomforest.py file analyzes the malaria data in order to predict clearence.

The  `ESL-ML_archieve` contains the R files, which we base our analysis off of, comes from the ESL-ML repository.

The ESL-ML can be found here:
https://github.com/caiwjohn/EPS-ML



## Malaria Data
The data used comes from ESP-ML and each dataset originates from Zhu et al. and Mok et al. respectfully. The datasets are included in the `malaria_data` directory.

In order to effectily run a random forest algorithm, the original malarai date, mok_meta.txt, is split into two seperate files. One for training and one for modeling.

## Dependencies
Python3 

SkiLearn

## Build Procedure
~

### Appendix
Clearence - measurement of per volume of plasma in which a substance is completely removed per unit time
